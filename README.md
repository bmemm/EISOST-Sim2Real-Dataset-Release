# Endoscopic Images generated from SOFA-based oropharynx model with style transfer from phantom (EISOST)
EISOST is a Sim-to-Real oropharyngeal organs segmentation dataset, including 1397 labeld images. The dataset consists of 3 necessary oropharyngeal organs, namely, the uvula, epiglottis, and glottis. Training data includes 1194 images sampled from SOFA-based oropharynx model. Test data includes 203 images captured on a real-world phantom. For the annotations, we provide coarse and fine annotations at the pixel level, including instance-level labels for oropharyngeal organs.
